  Quite easy really ... not what I recall from 1978?
  Must look at that when it comes to the surface
  Mind you, this is all nonsense as one still does not
  understand fully Turing completeness etc.
  Bit like bwa implementation versus why it is important?
  Or ... explaining brown bear graphs without the reason for
  their existence wrt velvet and friends (a lesser crime as
  this link is relatively transparent)
  What the hell ... filled the space where life should be
  for a happily passed moment or ten
  Far to many moments actually!!! Should have been able to
  knock this one out much faster surely!? Not even very pretty code.

  Might tidy up sometime? Read problems from files? Data checking!!!
  Hmmm ... but why Dave?

  .... bad question! Never has an answer

  Do it in Python? Some things would be very neat I think?
  Is there not a dictionary, tuple, whatever here and there?
  and that bit about finding a char position in a string would
  be trivial!

  Pity PYTHON is only for boys and wimpy women :-)

  Not a good entrance to C++ methinks,but could be wrong here?
  Never get around to  C++ dear boy. Stay with the obtainable!

  The engine:
  ***********

  Basically:

     Set up up an example tape
       Define and Wipe
     Set up up an example set of Rules/States
       Define and initialise according to notes below

     Do it?

  Where "Do it" I have in my head and will allow to dribble onto the
  page in disorder.

--------------------------------------------

  Format of a problem:
  ********************

  Also must think of the Problem. I start with "Add One" to a given number.
  This I bolt into the code in a fashion that can be, optionally,
  overwritten by other problems read from files.

  So, problems, specifically the "Add One" Rules:

  First an alphabet presented as a string.
  The last char will always be '~', used to represented wiped Tape cells.

  For Example ("Add One"):

                             "01~"

  Then a number of ordered STATES
  The first 3 STATES are mandatory. Further STATES depend on the problem
  For example ("Add One"):

  State 0: ERROR ... ends execution with a rude       message

  State 1: HALT  ... ends execution with a triumphant message

  State 2: START ... sets the initial conditions for the problem

           In this example:

           Purpose - to check Tape head is in a feasible position.
           The tape head can start anywhere in the body of the initial
           problem data (number to be incremented in this case).

           If the initial Tape cell is Clean/Empty/Wiped
                       Do nothing but move to the ERROR STATE

           I suppose problems might exist where starting on a wiped Tape cell
           is legal? But I ignore this for now.
           It would be a trivial "mandatory feature" to side step anyway.

********** END OF MANDATORY FEATURES - problem specific from here on *********

           If a legal character ('0' or '1' in this case) is read then write nothing,
                              move up the Tape (RIGHT),
                              move to SLIDE STATE (first fully problem specific STATE).

State 3: SLIDE ... Moves to the last character of the initial problem data
           Method - move forward (RIGHT) until first wiped tape cell,
           then move back (LEFT) one step.

           Remain in SLIDE STATE until objective achieved, then move to ADD STATE.

State 3: ADD   ... Increment the initial binary number by MOVING back down (LEFT)
           the number changing all 1s to 0s, remaining in STATE ADD

           If a 0 is read, change it to a 1 and move to BACK STATE.
           Incrementation has been achieved.

           If a wiped cell is encountered, the initial number must have been all 1s.
           Write a 1, extending the number one char to the left and increasing its
           value by 1. Incrementation has been achieved.
           Move to HALT STATE as Tape Head is in the required end position.
           That is, the first char of the incremented number.

State 4: BACK  ... Job done, but need to position the Tape Head over the first char
           of the solution. Why?. Because I bloody say so!

           If the current char is 0 or 1, move back (LEFT), write nothing (SKIP),
           remain in BACK STATE.

           If the current current Tape cell is wiped, you have overshot, so
           move forward (RIGHT), write nothing (SKIP), move to HALT STATE, job done.

  Problems, generally can be a series of rows of 3 integers representing
  DIRECTION (for Tape Head to move), NEXT_CHAR (to be written to current
  Tape Head position) and NEXT_STATE (to determine next actions).

  The Rows to be ordered by state and then by Current Tape Character
  (ranked by position in the allowed alphabet). The Add One Example:

      STATE   CHAR   ||  DIRECTION     NEXT_CHAR      NEXT_STATE
      ==========================================================
      ERROR    ~     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      ERROR    0     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      ERROR    1     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      HALT     ~     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      HALT     0     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      HALT     1     ||  HOLD          SKIP           -
      START    ~     ||  HOLD          SKIP           ERROR
      START    0     ||  RIGHT         SKIP           -
      START    1     ||  RIGHT         SKIP           -
      ADD      ~     ||  HOLD          1              HALT
      ADD      0     ||  LEFT          1              BACK
      ADD      1     ||  LEFT          0              ADD
      BACK     ~     ||  RIGHT         SKIP           HALT
      BACK     0     ||  LEFT          SKIP           BACK
      BACK     1     ||  LEFT          SKIP           BACK

Any time illegal character (not included in the current Alphabet) encountered
is considered an error. This is not really a Turing machine issue. It is simply
a malformed problem definition. So, not included in the problem definition, or
dealt with by moving to the ERROR STATE. Just a simple data checking conditional.

In fact, never comfortable with the ERROR STATE? It too is only needed to detect
a malformed problem. However, one needs to react to a condition that can occur,
theoretically, in the START state for which there exists no logical action?

What the hell, this is just supposed to be a bit of fun, not a chase along
gossamer spider threads that float through the summer sunlight!

Which causes one to wonder what gossamer means? Well well well! "a fine, filmy
substance consisting of cobwebs spun by small spiders, seen especially in autumn".
By the Lord Harry ... am I good or what? The term can be used more generally to
refer to anything with the properties of ... what it says ... and is also a jolly
nice word!

However ... it occurs that "gossamer spider threads", in the light of the above, becomes tautological! Better better just "gossamer threads" or maybe even just "gossamer"!. Indeed dear comrade, please read "gossamer that floats through the
late summer sunlight". Must use that somewhere? Corny? But pretty.
