Rules for Add One Turing Machine
================================

Alphabet "01" plus "~" for wiped tape

States:
-------

START, starting anywhere in the intitial binary number should work, starting in clean tape is an ERROR.

SLIDE, whilst in SLIDE, head moves to the end of the Data into clean tape and then moves back to the last binary digit.

ADD assumes a start on final binasry digit. It moves back along the Data changing all 1s to 0s. It changes the first 0 it meets to a  1 and then HALTs. If it meets clean tape befor a 1, it prepends a 1 to the data and HALTS.

BACK simply returns the Tape Head to the start of the incremented Data. This need not be the original Start of Data as the Data might have been extended one character to the left.
