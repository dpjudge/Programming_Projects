<b>Allegra Via</b> is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute 
of Biomembranes and Bioenergetics (IBBE) of the National Research 
Council (CNR, Bari, IT). In 2003, she got her PhD at the University 
of Rome "Tor Vergata", where she also worked six years as postdoc. In 
2009 she moved to the Sapienza University as researcher, and, since 
January 2016, she works full time as the ELIXIR Italy Training 
Coordinator. She is involved in the design, organisation and delivery 
of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, 
and collaborates with other ELIXIR's nodes on many training-related 
initiatives. She has a long track record of academic teaching 
(Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, 
Biochemistry, Protein interactions). Her main research interests 
include protein structural bioinformatics, protein function 
prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. She is a member of 
the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and 
Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry instructor.
She has created the first Python course in <b>GTPB</b> in 2010 and has 
been an instructor in all the editions of GTPB ever since. In 2014, 
she co-authored "Managing your biological data with Python", a book that
budded from her experience as a training designer and as an instructor.

					<h2>Course Description</h2>
<b>Python</b> is an object-oriented programming language that is ideal for biological data analysis. The course will start from zero knowledge, and will introduce 
the participants to all the basic concepts of Python such as calculating, organizing data, reading and writing files, program logic and writing larger programs. All 
the examples and practical sessions will focus on solving biological problems.

In particular the sessions will cover:<br>
<ul>
<li>working with DNA and protein sequences</li>
<li>data retrieval from files and their manipulation</li>
<li>running applications, such as BLAST, locally and from a script</li>
<li>finding motifs in sequence</li>
<li>parsing common file formats (Uniprot, GenBank, PDB, BLAST) with Biopython</li>
<li>ways to find and correct program errors</li>
</ul>
The course will be highly interactive and the students will continuously put theory into practice while learning. By the end of the course, the participants will have
a good understanding of Python basics and will have acquired the skills to manage any type of bioinformatics database record and to run applications from scripts. Basic 
Unix/Linux skills will be provided at the beginning of the course.
<br>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
End-users of bioinformatics databases and tools that aim at developing hands-on capabilities for biological data analysis, ie writing their own or adapting somebody else's 
Python scripts in an autonomous way.<br>
<h2>Course Pre-requisites</h2>
Basic familiarity with bioinformatics data resources such as Uniprot/Swiss-Prot, Blast, ENSEMBL, PDB, etc. The course is directed to biologists with little or no programming 
experience and aims at making them capable to use Python to autonomously manage and analyse biological data.
